## Overview
- As we know that HTTP is written over TCP (ignoring HTTP/3) we created an abstract class for a TCP server
- The TCPServer class has all the implementation of creating, binding, listenting socket and accepting requests.
- The derived classes will inherit from TCPServer and will have to implement the abstract method `processRequest`. Given each protocol on top of TCP has something different.
- The HTTPServer will inherit from TCPServer and implement its own logic for processing the request and sending the response.
- We can extend this to even implement a Layer 7 or Layer 4 Loadbalancer.
